Hi, I moved the script to here:

https://github.com/joshgallantt/windowsprintermanager/blob/main/Windows%20Printer%20Manager/windows-printer-manager.ps1

You can Download the file with an example driver here:

https://github.com/joshgallantt/windowsprintermanager/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

Just drag the folder to your desktop and run start.ps1.. it will install a HP printer as an example, just dont forget to uninstall it.

Example: C:\Users\Josh\Desktop\Windows Printer Manager\start.ps1
